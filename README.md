## Setting Up Quizes ##

- go to "github.com/jaderigby" and clone "codeForLift-handle-setup" in the Documents folder

- Once you have done this, run the following command:

  `python <path to handle-setup2.py> --quizes`

  This does the following:
  - installs the quizes repo
  - creates the necessary "profile.py" file
  - add the quizes alias to the ".bashrc" file

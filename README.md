## Setting Up Quizes ##

- Clone the "codeForLift-handle-setup" repo into your Documents folder

- Once you have done this, run the following command:

  `python <path to setup.py> --exec`

- This will set up your setup.py file to be run as an executable. Run the following command to update your bash session:

  `source ~/.bashrc`

- To install the quizes, run the following:

  `setup.py --quizes`

  What this does:
  - installs the quizes repo
  - creates the necessary "profile.py" file
  - adds the quizes alias to the ".bashrc" file
